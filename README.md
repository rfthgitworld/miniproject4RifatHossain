# Expense Tracker (Django Application)

## Description

The **Expense Tracker** is a personal web-based financial management tool built with **Python** and the **Django** framework. It is designed to help users efficiently manage and monitor their personal finances by logging, organizing, and tracking expenses.

**Key Features:**
* **User Authentication:** Secure registration and login functionality using Django's built-in authentication system.
* **Expense Tracking:** Users can record expenses with details like title, amount, date, and notes.
* **Category Management:** Expenses are linked to user-specific categories for easy filtering and organization.
* **Dashboard View:** A centralized dashboard provides quick access to recent expenses and the total amount spent.
* **SQLite Database:** Uses SQLite as the default database for development and testing.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Dependencies

First, create a direct called (`expense_tracker_project/`) and navigate into the directory and install the required Python packages using pip:

```
mkdir expense_tracker_project

cd expense_tracker_project

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Initialize the database

Before running the application, the database must be initialized and a superuser created. Ensure you are in the `expense_tracker_project/` directory where `manage.py` is located.

1. **Create database migrations:** This command generates the SQL entries required by the models in the `expenses` app.**

2.  **Run the Flask initialization command:**

    ```
    python manage.py makemigrations
    ```
3. **Apply migrations to the database:** This command executes the migrations, creating the necessary database tables (and the `db.sqlite3 file`).**

   ```
    python manage.py migrate
   ```
4. **Create a Superuser (Administrator):** This command creates the administrator login for your /admin side of the project. Follow the prompts to set a username, email, and password.

   ```
    python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

### Program Execution

Once the database is initialized, you can start the development server

1. **Run the Django Development Server:** Ensure you are in the expense_tracker_project/ directory..**

    ```
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

2. **Access the Application:** 
   1. Open your web browser and navigate to the local server address: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`
   2. To access the admin dashboard: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` and log in with the superuser credentials you created earlier.

You can now register a new user or log in with your superuser credentials to begin tracking your expenses.
